This is the final project for the course of Introductory Data Mining at Florida Atlantic University (FAU).
For this project, the dataset is audio-files, for 3 ship-types. There are supposed to be 4 ship-types, but one of them never exists in the dataset.
The goal is to classify the noise in the audio-files, converted to spectrograms, by ship-type.
